# Smoothing-RTA
We are exploring the effectiveness of smoothing techniques on synthetic RNP data to enhance trend detection in rate-transient analysis (RTA), focusing on improving flow regime identification and reservoir characteristics.

# About the Project
This repository contains the research and implementation of various smoothing techniques applied to rate-normalized pressure (RNP) data aimed at improving trend detection in rate-transient analysis (RTA). Our study evaluates the effectiveness of these methods in identifying underlying patterns and enhancing the accuracy of critical metrics like flow regime times and reservoir characteristics.

# Project Highlights
- Comparison of Five Smoothing Methods: Evaluating their performance based on the sum of square errors (SSE).
- Optimization of LoWeSS Parameters: Identifying the optimal window size and its impact on noise reduction.
- Detailed Analysis of Smoothing Outcomes: Assessing the accuracy improvements in parameter extraction and the robustness of the methods against various noise levels and outlier scenarios.

# Data
The dataset used comprises noisy synthetic RNP data from a homogenous, single-layer, low-permeability gas reservoir, as described by Munthe and Lee (2024). This includes data manipulated with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under several noise-presence scenarios.
